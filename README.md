    - Use `npm install`

* In the BackEnd Folder, `.env` file change the `MONGO_URL` to your data-base link. 


* Also note that `PORT` is set to `5000` in `.env` file but it is used for AirPlay in MAC-OS, for resolving this, [follow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69818376/localhost5000-unavailable-in-macos-v12-monterey).
